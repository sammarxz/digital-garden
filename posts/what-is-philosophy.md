Man created the gods in his own image, through myths. These were used to explain the world around him. Everything was based on faith. Then man put these myths on paper and saw that things didn't quite work that way. Questioning began, and that's when philosophy was born, to try to understand the world through reason.

To philosophize means never to stop being amazed by life. Not to see everything as a closed matter and to marvel simply at the fact of living, of residing on a grain of sand in the desert, of becoming like a child again where every novelty was magical.
